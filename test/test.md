# Test about

Test was made by comparing outputs from `prominence.py` and `test.py`

`test.py` is created using `scipy` and `numpy` module.

The code of `test.py` is simple:

```python3
from scipy.signal import find_peaks, peak_prominences
import numpy as np

def prominence(x):
    peaks, _ = find_peaks(x)
    prominences = peak_prominences(x, peaks)[0]

    res = []

    for p in prominences:
        res.append(int(p))
        print(int(p))

values = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]  # enter velues splitted by space
values.append(0)
values.insert(0, 0)

prominence(h)


#### input ####
# 47 43 47 42 48 48 42

#### output ####
# 5
# 5
# 48
```
